# Garage Utilities

Adds new features to the garage:
- adds a player options button, for customizing options that should be in the garage in the first place:
  - mini icon default
  - switch spider teleport color
  - switch dash fire color
  - switch wave trail color
- shift-click an icon to open its unlock popup without selecting it (sorry, Android users)
- arrows in unlock popups, so you can easily go to the next and previous icons without closing and reopening the popup
- unlocking supporter icons
  - used to be able to get them by rating the game, they became free later
  - this has been broken in since 2.2, so icons 13 (Supporter) and 71 (Meltdown Supporter) are unobtainable in the base game
  - to unlock them, just click them
    - icon 71 requires More Games by [BitZ](user:7624979) to be installed
- ability to hide diamond shards from the garage, compatible with [Capeling](user:18226543)'s Demons In Garage 2.2
- icon kit filtering and sorting
